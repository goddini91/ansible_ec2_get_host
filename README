NOTE: This script assumes Ansible is being executed where the environment
variables needed for Boto have already been set:
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=''
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='jhgjh'


This script also assumes that there is an ec2.ini file alongside it.  To specify a
different path to ec2.ini, define the EC2_INI_PATH environment variable:

    export EC2_INI_PATH=/path/to/my_ec2.ini
